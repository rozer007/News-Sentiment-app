   - Extracts key points while preserving critical information
   - Implementation: Uses structured prompting with a context window of up to 30,000 tokens

2. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Performs multi-dimensional sentiment analysis across several aspects:
     - Overall sentiment (positive, neutral, negative)
     - Financial impact assessment (very negative to very positive on a -5 to +5 scale)
     - Reputation impact assessment
     - Market reaction prediction
   - Implementation: Uses specialized prompting that includes examples to guide the model

3. **Cross-Article Analysis**:
   - Identifies common themes, contradictions, and unique insights across multiple articles
   - Generates a comprehensive meta-analysis of the news landscape for a company
   - Implementation: Uses a specialized prompt that combines multiple article summaries as context

### Translation and Text-to-Speech Models

1. **Googletrans (Translation)**:
   - Uses Google Translate's unofficial API to translate English text to Hindi
   - Implementation: Provides natural-sounding translations with specialized handling for financial terminology

2. **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)**:
   - Converts Hindi translated text into natural-sounding speech
   - Produces MP3 audio files that can be played in the web interface
   - Implementation: Uses the Hindi language model with slow=False for natural speech cadence

## Separation of Concerns

This application demonstrates clean separation of concerns:

1. **Backend API (api.py)**:
   - Responsible for data processing and persistence
   - Handles all interactions with external services (Gemini AI, news sources)
   - Provides a consistent API for data access

2. **Frontend UI (app.py)**:
   - Focuses on data visualization and user interaction
   - Consumes the API for all data needs
   - Falls back to local file access only if the API is unavailable

This separation allows for:
- Independent development and testing of each component
- Potential for multiple frontend applications using the same API
- Better maintainability and scalability

## Performance Considerations

- The application is designed for moderate loads and can handle analysis of ~100 companies daily
- For larger deployments, consider:
  - Implementing a proper database instead of file-based storage
  - Setting up a Redis cache for frequent queries
  - Deploying behind a load balancer with multiple API instances
  - Implementing more robust rate limiting for news scraping
  - Using a paid translation API for production use
